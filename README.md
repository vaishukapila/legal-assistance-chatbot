I developed an AI-powered legal assistant that can help people understand legal documents and get quick answers to their legal questions. The chatbot is able to read and extract text from PDFs and images, analyze contracts for risks and compliance, and even generate legal documents such as NDAs, MOUs, or partnership agreements.

I also added voice and multilingual support, which means users can speak their queries, hear the responses, and even translate them into different languages like Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, and English. The system can also suggest relevant case laws and precedents based on a query.

The project is built with Streamlit for the interface, Google Gemini AI for analysis, OCR tools for text extraction, and speech-to-text and text-to-speech for voice features. My main goal was to create a simple, accessible, and user-friendly system that makes legal information easier to understand.

**This chatbot is only for guidance and educational purposesâ€”it is not a replacement for professional legal advice.**
